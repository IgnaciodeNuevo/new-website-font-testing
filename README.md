# New Website Font Testing

This is a test for my new website. The purpose is to test online fonts.

## What I'm testing:

- Methods to load fonts
- Font weights
- Sizes
- Loading strategies.

Do NOT steal the fonts if you see this, please this fonts are testing purpose only. Buy them from their distributors.
